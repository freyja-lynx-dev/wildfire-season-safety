# Wildfire season safety!

With the summer fast approaching, arm yourself with the knowledge to protect your health.

## Check the Air Quality Index (AQI):
 - The AQI will help you figure out what kinds of measures you should take to protect your health. Starting around 100 AQI is where most people should consider limiting strenuous physical activity, and those with health conditions that impact breathing should consider limiting outdoors activity at all.
## Mask up!
The same masks you use for protecting against illness will also protect you from wildfire smoke! Use an N95, KN95, KF94, or other equivalent. Unlike with protection against airborne illness, **a mask with a respiration valve is acceptable** for protecting against wildfire smoke, and help improve comfort by minimizing moisture buildup and the "hot box" effect some masks have.

While for airborne illnesses you can generally reuse a mask multiple times, you should not do this with major AQI events like wildfires. **Replace your mask or respirator filter when it is visibly dirty.**
## Purify the air!
Simply staying inside won't shield you from wildfire smoke, especially if you live in an older home, need to keep the windows open, or the air quality index is simply really high! Here's some recommended options for air purification at home:
 - If you have central air: Upgrade your furnace filter! You probably have some piece of crap filter in there already if you haven't chosen it yourself -- get the highest MERV rated filter you can find that fits your furnace. Now every time you use your AC, heating, or central fan the air is purified for you!
  - Cheap: build one yourself! All you need is a box fan, a furnace filter sized for your box fan, and duct tape. Simply tape the filter to the outtake side of the box fan and **leave no gaps**. These won't work quite as well as dedicated air purifiers, but they can make use of stuff you may already have lying around the house! **Just keep in mind you are abusing your box fan beyond its design intent -- you should probably not leave it on when you leave the home just in case your fan burns out from the abuse.**
  - Optimal: Buy a dedicated air purifier with a HEPA filter!

### Here's some general tips for choosing air purifiers:
 - For central air or DIY -- get the highest rated MERV filters you can afford. My personal minimum would be MERV 14, but you know your wallet and local offerings best. Learn what MERV ratings are, and the difference between MERV and HEPA [with this article from Learn Metrics](https://learnmetrics.com/merv-rating-chart/).
 - If a dedicated air purifier doesn't specify that it's HEPA, you might as well just build one with furnace filters instead. HEPA filters remove 99.97% of particles whose average size is equal to 0.3 microns.
 - Air purifiers are simple machines -- they're specialized fans that blow air into a filter. As long as they use HEPA filters, the only real differences between different options are cost, aesthetics, availability of aftermarket filters, and manufacturer reliability. Read reviews and make sure your dedicated air purifier will be a lasting investment instead of e-waste.
 - Not all carbon pre-filters are built equally -- if an air purifier you're looking at claims to have a carbon filter, check to make sure it's composed of carbon pellets and not just a mesh web with a carbon coating. Carbon pellets are far more effective at neutralizing odors and are often washable. Again, **as long as it says HEPA**, it will protect you against wildfire smoke -- don't be swayed into spending more by hullabaloo!
 - You will need to replace your filters on a regular basis. DIY box fan filters should be replaced every three months. A store-bought purifier will tell you its replacement interval in the manual, usually between 6 and 12 months. In any case, you should replace your filters after major AQI incidents like wildfires -- buy a few replacements with your purifier!
 
 An air purifier does more than just protect you from wildfire smoke -- it can help reduce pollen or pet dander indoors, and some purifiers include carbon pellet filters which can reduce odors. Keep your air purifier on 24/7 -- you only stand to benefit from cleaner air even when there's no smoke outside.
 
## Helpful links:
 - Consult [AirNow, affiliated with the EPA](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/) for information about the Air Quality Index and how to keep yourself safe from air pollutants.
 - To find a good air purifier, a video like [this one from Vacuum Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzHSI1S--FU) is a great place to start. I can personally recommend Winix -- I own two 5500-2s and an A230. The company is well respected, has an excellent track record, and has replacement filters easily available from both Winix themselves and from third party manufacturers. They are not the only brand worth purchasing, just one I can actually recommend.
 - For disposable masks, [Project N95](https://www.projectn95.org/) maintains a list of N95-class masks they previously tested and sold when the nonprofit maintained a storefront. If you have a N95 you like already, buy more of it!
 - For reusable respirators, I highly recommend [the Envomask](https://envomask.com/) -- it's super comfortable to wear over long periods of time, has a reversible respiration valve to protect you inside from airborne illnesses while not compromising on comfort outside, and has easily available replacement masks. You can also find N95-class respirators at your local hardware store, many of which will be cheaper than the Envomask while sacrificing some amount of comfort and being a bit bulkier.
